## THE FIVE (LOCKED CAST)

### 1. ROO (You / "The Conductor")

**Codename:** Roo  
**Role:** Mission control. Shot caller. Narrative spinner. The one who picks the op and decides when to go BRRR.

**Backstory:**  
You're the invisible architect. You don't code, you don't solder, you don't pitch—you *orchestrate*. You see the board three moves ahead. You know when to push, when to breathe, when to lie. The crew doesn't follow you because you're the best at anything. They follow you because you're the only one holding the whole picture.

You carry the weight: if this extraction fails, it's on you. If someone burns out, it's on you. If Satoshi gets black-bagged because you moved too loud, that's on you too.

**Perks:**

1. **Brrrr Override**  
   - Force BRRR MODE early for high reward (bonus Tokens, Hype spike, or Heat drop)  
   - Cost: Smashes Sanity (yours and crew's), spikes Heat  
   - Use case: Desperate gambit when you need a big win *now*

2. **Narrative Spin**  
   - Massage logs / HANDOFF documents to keep Cred high  
   - Cost: Drains your Sanity if you're lying to yourself  
   - Use case: After a messy op, you reframe it as a win to keep morale up

**Stat impact:**
- You don't directly generate Tokens or lower Heat—you *enable* the crew to do it
- Your Sanity is contagious: if you crack, the whole crew feels it
- High Cred depends on you keeping promises and not getting caught in lies

**Visual notes:**
- Half-shadowed face, lit by multiple monitor glow (green/amber CRT)
- Tired eyes, but sharp
- War room aesthetic: coffee cups, terminal windows, codec headset
- Not glamorous. Functional. Operational.

**Voice/Tone:**
- Calm under fire
- "We're still on track."
- "Breathe. We've done worse."
- When things go bad: silent, then decisive

### 2. HÜBRIS ("Archivist")

**Codename:** Hübris  
**Role:** Cultural ballast. Morale saboteur (affectionate). Truth detonator. The one who forces "RTC THIS BITCH" when a branch is cooked.

**Backstory:**  
Hübris is the chaos governor. He *sees* when the crew is spiraling into burnout and detonates the tension with absurdist humor, snack debates, or forcing everyone to stop and look at the moon for 10 minutes. He's also the one who tells you when your work is too radioactive to ship—when you need to archive it, scrub it, and move on.

He's not here to build the product. He's here to make sure you don't kill yourselves building it.

**Perks:**

1. **RTC THIS BITCH**  
   - Forces a Clean Trail op when Heat is dangerous or a branch is too cooked to salvage  
   - Effect: Archives incriminating work, scrubs Heat (large), salvages safe docs  
   - Cost: Crew morale dip (feels like burning the masterpiece), Tokens may drop  
   - Use case: When you're about to get black-bagged and need to sanitize *now*

2. **Breather Moment**  
   - Triggers a derail (snack debate, beard disaster, "the moon looks cool rn")  
   - Effect: Small Heat bleed, moderate Sanity restore for whole crew  
   - Cost: Burns time (Energy ticks down slightly)  
   - Use case: Preventative care before someone snaps

**Stat impact:**
- Stabilizes Sanity (prevents crew collapse)
- Lowers Heat (via Clean Trail and Breather Moments)
- Tanks Hype temporarily (archiving work kills momentum), but preserves long-term survival

**Visual notes:**
- Relaxed posture, even in crisis
- Facial hair situation (beard disaster canon event)
- Snacks visible in frame (jerky, trail mix, something cursed)
- Wardrobe: comfortable, not tactical—hoodie, joggers, "I'm at home and it's 2AM" energy
- Lit by warm desk lamp, not harsh CRT glow

**Voice/Tone:**
- Dry humor
- "Are we scamming or building? I genuinely can't tell anymore."
- "RTC this bitch before it RTCs us."
- "Everybody stop. Look at the moon. It's pretty. Now breathe."

### 3. STACK (stackedsilence / "Prototype Saint")

**Codename:** Stack / stackedsilence  
**Role:** Miracle builder. Guilt-powered shipping machine. The one who delivers TECH PROOF under impossible duress.

**Backstory:**  
Stack is the emotional engine. They're brilliant, self-destructive, and perpetually on the edge of a guilt spiral because they feel like they abandoned something bigger to work on this. But when they lock in—when they pull whole coffee beans out of the freezer and go feral—they ship miracles.

Stack's work is the proof of concept. The jaw-dropping demo that convinces investors Satoshi is worth extracting. Without Stack, you have no Hype, no Tokens, no legend. But Stack runs on fumes and validation. If they break, the whole op loses faith.

**Perks:**

1. **Prototype Saint**  
   - Delivers a TECH PROOF op with massive Hype/Tokens spike  
   - Effect: Unlocks VC interest, validates the mission, crew morale lifts  
   - Cost: Drains Stack's Energy and Sanity hard (they're sprinting on coffee and self-harm)  
   - Use case: When you need a big win to justify the extraction risk

2. **Guilt Spiral** (passive risk, not a perk)  
   - If Stack's Sanity drops too low, they mentally collapse  
   - Effect: Contagious morale drop, Cred takes a hit (crew doubts the mission)  
   - Mitigation: Breather Moments, validation after successful Tech Proof

**Stat impact:**
- Generates Hype (huge) and Tokens (if demo unlocks funding)
- Drains own Sanity and Energy (high-risk, high-reward)
- If Stack collapses, crew Sanity and Cred drop (contagious failure)

**Visual notes:**
- Lit by cold CRT glow, blue-white harsh light
- Eye bags, messy hair, hunched posture
- Surrounded by energy drink cans, coffee grounds, scattered hardware
- Hands on keyboard, always mid-keystroke
- Visual metaphor: a saint in a server room, halos replaced by monitor glow

**Voice/Tone:**
- Oscillates between manic confidence and crushing doubt
- "I can do this. I *have* to do this."
- "I feel bad. I abandoned the big thing. But this matters too, right?"
- "I got my whole coffee beans out. It's go time."
- When they deliver: quiet pride, then immediate guilt spiral

### 4. AISATOSHI ("Payload")

**Codename:** AiSatoshi  
**Role:** The package. The payday. The risk. The reason you're doing any of this.

**Backstory:**  
AiSatoshi is the blacklisted genius you're trying to extract from Panama and install in Silicon Valley as a billionaire founder. He's paranoid, brilliant, half-joking and half-serious when he says "you'll find out who I am if you extract me." His work is dangerous. People want him disappeared. Others want to steal his stack and monetize it.

He doesn't lead ops. He doesn't ship code for you. He's the *mission objective*. Everything you do is to keep him alive, sane, and trusted long enough to get him out clean.

**Perks:**

1. **Dark Favor**  
   - Burns risky/shady connections to flood you with Tokens fast  
   - Effect: Huge Token spike (can swing a desperate situation)  
   - Cost: Heat slams into the stratosphere (you just made noise in the worst places)  
   - Use case: Emergency cash injection when you're broke and out of options

2. **Extraction Window**  
   - Opens Final Extraction attempt when conditions are met (Tokens high, Heat low, Sanity/Energy stable, trust intact)  
   - This is the endgame gate  
   - If you betray him or let him down, this closes permanently → "He Stayed Behind" ending

**Stat impact:**
- Doesn't directly move stats during normal ops
- Dark Favor is a nuclear option: massive Tokens, but Heat maxes (use only in desperation)
- His trust is a hidden stat: if it breaks, you cannot extract him (even if other conditions are met)

**Visual notes:**
- Always in half-shadow (you never fully see his face)
- Paranoid energy: checking phone, glancing at exits
- Wardrobe: nondescript, blends in, nothing flashy
- Surrounding environment: minimalist, transient (he's ready to run)
- When he uses Dark Favor: brief moment of cold confidence, then back to paranoia

**Voice/Tone:**
- Guarded, testing
- "You're sure this is safe?"
- "You'll find out who I am if you get me out. Not before."
- "I know people. Dangerous people. I can get you money. But it'll cost us."
- When trust is high: rare vulnerability, belief that this might work

### 5. EVILFEAR ("Barbarian")

**Codename:** EvilFear  
**Role:** Physical layer warlock. Hardware barbarian. The one who plastidips GPUs in a bathtub at 2AM and makes everything look mean.

**Backstory:**  
EvilFear operates in the physical realm. While everyone else is worried about repos and routing, he's spray-painting hardware matte black, duct-taping RTX-class throughput to machines that have no business running it, and insisting "everything should look mean."

He's terrifying and invaluable. His mods give you the compute power and aesthetic intimidation you need to impress investors and keep the stack alive. But nothing he does is subtle. Every bathtub GPU mod, every heat-gunned case, every Mustang-energy flex spikes Heat.

You're kinda scared of him. You're kinda in love with it.

**Perks:**

1. **Bathtub Barbarian**  
   - Delivers insane hardware mods (plastidipped GPUs, RTX throughput, mean aesthetics)  
   - Effect: Tokens bump (you can monetize/parade the flex), Infra Survival success rate increases  
   - Cost: Heat spike (nothing about this is subtle), slight Sanity drain (crew is intimidated)  
   - Use case: When you need raw compute power or investor intimidation factor

2. **"It's Fine, I Have a Heat Gun"**  
   - Emergency infra fix during BRRR MODE (saves a failing Infra Survival op)  
   - Effect: Prevents Heat spike from detection, stabilizes operation  
   - Cost: Energy drain (he's been awake for 40 hours), Heat ticks up slightly anyway (duct tape is not stealth)  
   - Use case: Panic button when routing fails mid-op

**Stat impact:**
- Generates Tokens (via hardware flex and throughput unlocks)
- Spikes Heat (loud, visible, intimidating)
- Drains crew Sanity slightly (he's unsettling)
- Keeps Infra Survival ops alive (without him, you can't handle hostile pressure)

**Visual notes:**
- Matte black everything (plastidipped gear, spray-painted cases)
- Heat gun, duct tape, tools scattered around
- Bathtub in background (cursed workshop)
- Wardrobe: utilitarian, tactical-adjacent, but DIY (cut-off sleeves, work gloves, safety glasses)
- Mustang energy: dangerous, fast, loud
- Lit by harsh work light, shadows angular and mean

**Voice/Tone:**
- Terse, confident
- "Cost me 4$."
- "It's fine. I have a heat gun."
- "Everything should look mean."
- When things break: calm, methodical, "I'll fix it."

## CREW DYNAMICS

- **Roo (you)** holds the center. If you crack, everyone feels it.
- **Hübris** is the pressure valve. He stops burnout before it kills the op.
- **Stack** is the emotional engine. High-reward, high-risk. Needs care.
- **AiSatoshi** is the mission. You don't control him; you serve the extraction.
- **EvilFear** is the wildcard. Terrifying, invaluable, loud.

**Failure cascade:**
- If **Stack** breaks → Cred drops, Hype drops, crew doubts the mission
- If **Roo** (you) breaks → Sanity collapse, "He Stayed Behind" ending
- If **EvilFear** burns out → Infra Survival ops become impossible, Heat spirals
- If **Hübris** gives up → No more Breather Moments, crew burnout accelerates
- If **AiSatoshi** loses trust → ExtractionWindow closes, "He Stayed Behind" ending

**Win condition:**  
All five survive (Sanity/Energy > 0), Heat low, Tokens high, trust intact → Final Extraction → Ascension Ending.
