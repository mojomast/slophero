**Timeline:** Next sprint  

---

## 🎯 CORE GOALS

2. **Crystal clear cause → effect** - Players know what choices do
3. **More branching chaos** - Every run feels different
4. **Celebrity encounters everywhere** - 50+ scenarios, cascading consequences
5. **Variety in gameplay loops** - Operations feel distinct, strategies emerge

---

## 📋 PRIORITY 1: MAKE CREW PERKS MATTER

### Current State (v0.1)
- ✅ 4 perks exist (BREATHER, RTC THIS, BRRR NOW, DARK FAVOR)
- ✅ Basic functionality works
- ❌ Don't feel impactful enough
- ❌ Cooldowns too simple
- ❌ No synergy between perks

### What To Add

#### **Perk Upgrades & Unlocks**
- **Perk Evolution System**
  - Each perk has 3 tiers (unlocked by usage)
  - Tier 1: Basic (current state)
  - Tier 2: Unlocks at 3 uses (enhanced effects)
  - Tier 3: Unlocks at 7 uses (game-changing)
  
- **Hübris BREATHER Evolution**
  - Tier 1: +15 Sanity, -5 Heat, -3 Energy (current)
  - Tier 2: +20 Sanity, -10 Heat, -2 Energy, +5 Cred (crew respects the pause)
  - Tier 3: +25 Sanity, -15 Heat, no Energy cost, random celebrity joins the call

- **Hübris RTC THIS BITCH Evolution**
  - Tier 1: Force Clean Trail operation, 3-cycle cooldown (current)
  - Tier 2: Force Clean Trail + auto-success on first choice, 2-cycle cooldown
  - Tier 3: Scorched earth mode - wipe ALL Heat but -30 Tokens, 1-cycle cooldown

- **Roo BRRR NOW Evolution**
  - Tier 1: Skip ESCALATION, -15 Sanity, 2-cycle cooldown (current)
  - Tier 2: Skip ESCALATION, -10 Sanity, +20 Hype (legendary speed run), 2-cycle cooldown
  - Tier 3: Skip ESCALATION + BRRR MODE auto-resolves optimally, -5 Sanity, 1-cycle cooldown

- **AiSatoshi DARK FAVOR Evolution**
  - Tier 1: One-time +50 Tokens, +30 Heat (current)
  - Tier 2: UNLOCK: Can use twice, second use adds +15 Trust
  - Tier 3: UNLOCK: Third use available, becomes "FINAL CARD" - extraction succeeds even at 80% readiness but endings change

#### **Perk Synergies**
- **Combo Effects** - Using perks in sequence triggers bonuses
  - BREATHER → RTC THIS = "Calm Before Storm" (+10 Energy restored)
  - BRRR NOW → DARK FAVOR = "Desperation Play" (Heat increase halved)
  - RTC THIS → BREATHER = "Clean Slate Meditation" (+20 Sanity instead of +15)

#### **Visual Feedback**
- Perk buttons glow when upgraded
- Show tier progress bars under each button
- Flash effects when perks trigger
- Terminal log shows exact stat changes: `[PERK] BREATHER → +15 Sanity, -5 Heat`

---

## 📋 PRIORITY 2: CLEAR CAUSE → EFFECT

### Current State (v0.1)
- ✅ Stats change in real-time
- ❌ Players don't know WHAT changes will happen before choosing
- ❌ No preview of consequences
- ❌ Outcomes feel random

### What To Add

#### **Choice Previews**
- **Hover-to-Reveal System**
  - Hover over choice → Shows stat deltas in tooltip
  - Example: `[+10 Tokens, -5 Heat, +5 Cred]`
  - Color-coded: Green = good, Yellow = mixed, Red = risky
  
- **Risk Levels**
  - Every choice tagged: SAFE / BALANCED / RISKY / YOLO
  - Display risk level in choice button
  - SAFE = guaranteed small gains
  - BALANCED = medium gains, medium costs
  - RISKY = high variance, could be huge win or disaster
  - YOLO = maximum chaos, unpredictable outcomes

#### **Consequence Chains**
- **Choice Memory System**
  - Track all major decisions in `GameState.choiceHistory`
  - Future events reference past choices
  - Example: Helped Sam Altman → He tweets about you → Heat spike in 3 cycles
  - Example: Ignored Elon → He shorts your token → Tokens crash next cycle
  
- **"What Just Happened?" Log**
  - After each choice, show expanded consequence breakdown
  - Terminal log format:
    ```
    [CHOICE] You chose: "Use roo5's backup relay"
    [RESULT] Route stabilized (-10 Heat)
    [COST] Burned a favor with Roo (-5 Cred)
    [HIDDEN] Roo5 will remember this...
    ```

#### **Operation Specializations**
- Each operation type gives different bonuses
- **INFRA SURVIVAL** = Best for Heat reduction
- **TECH PROOF** = Best for Tokens/Hype gain
- **COVER STORY** = Best for Heat reduction + Cred boost
- **CLEAN TRAIL** = Emergency Heat wipe, expensive

- Add UI indicator: "Best for: [🔥 Heat Control]"
