```

**Current:** v0.1 - Deployed to Vercel, playable, solid foundation  
**Target:** v0.2 - Players say "holy shit this game is DEEP"  
**Timeline:** 4 weeks / 4 phases  
**Philosophy:** Make every choice feel consequential, every run feel unique

---

## 🎯 DESIGN PHILOSOPHY

**v0.1 was about:** Can we build it? Does it work? Can we ship it?  
**v0.2 is about:** Does it feel ALIVE? Do players understand it? Do they want MORE?

### The Three Pillars of v0.2

1. **TRANSPARENCY** - Players know what's happening and why
   - No hidden mechanics that feel like RNG
   - Clear previews of consequences
   - Visible progression systems

2. **CONSEQUENCE** - Choices echo through time
   - Early decisions affect late game
   - Celebrity relationships persist
   - Crew remembers your style

3. **EMERGENCE** - Depth without complexity
   - Simple rules create complex situations
   - Player-discovered strategies
   - "I didn't know you could do that" moments

---

## 🎯 CORE GOALS

1. **Make UI elements actually matter** - Crew perks feel powerful and strategic
2. **Crystal clear cause → effect** - Players understand choices before AND after
3. **More branching chaos** - Every playthrough tells a different story
4. **Celebrity encounters MEAN something** - 50+ scenarios with lasting impact
5. **Variety in gameplay** - Operations feel distinct, strategies emerge naturally
6. **Replayability** - Players finish once and immediately hit "new game"

---

## 📋 PRIORITY 1: MAKE CREW PERKS MATTER

### Problem Statement (v0.1)

Perks exist but feel like "press button, get number change." No progression, no strategy, no memorable moments. Players forget they exist.

**Current metrics (estimated):**
- Perk usage: ~30% of players use them
- Memorable moment: None
- Strategic depth: 2/10

**Target metrics (v0.2):**
- Perk usage: 90%+ of players use them multiple times
- Memorable moment: "Holy shit BREATHER Tier 3 saved my run"
- Strategic depth: 8/10

### The Big Idea

Perks should feel like **unlocking new powers in a Metroidvania**. You start weak, get stronger, discover combos, and eventually feel like a god.

### What To Add

#### **Perk Evolution System** 🔥

**Core Mechanic:** Each perk levels up through usage. Not XP, not points - just USE IT.

**Progression:**
- **Tier 1** (Start) - Basic effect, gets you familiar
- **Tier 2** (3 uses) - Enhanced, "oh this is actually good"
- **Tier 3** (7 uses) - Game-changing, "wait what the fuck"
- **Tier ∞** (15 uses) - Secret mastery unlock, discovered by 1% of players

**Example Flow:**
Player uses BREATHER → "ok that helped" → uses 2 more times → **TIER 2 UNLOCK** → terminal flashes: `[PERK EVOLVED] BREATHER → DEEP BREATHER` → next use is noticeably better → player thinks "holy shit" → starts planning around it
  
- **Hübris BREATHER Evolution**
  - Tier 1: +15 Sanity, -5 Heat, -3 Energy (current)
  - Tier 2: +20 Sanity, -10 Heat, -2 Energy, +5 Cred (crew respects the pause)
  - Tier 3: +25 Sanity, -15 Heat, no Energy cost, random celebrity joins the call

- **Hübris RTC THIS BITCH Evolution**
  - Tier 1: Force Clean Trail operation, 3-cycle cooldown (current)
  - Tier 2: Force Clean Trail + auto-success on first choice, 2-cycle cooldown
  - Tier 3: Scorched earth mode - wipe ALL Heat but -30 Tokens, 1-cycle cooldown

- **Roo BRRR NOW Evolution**
  - Tier 1: Skip ESCALATION, -15 Sanity, 2-cycle cooldown (current)
  - Tier 2: Skip ESCALATION, -10 Sanity, +20 Hype (legendary speed run), 2-cycle cooldown
  - Tier 3: Skip ESCALATION + BRRR MODE auto-resolves optimally, -5 Sanity, 1-cycle cooldown

- **AiSatoshi DARK FAVOR Evolution**
  - Tier 1: One-time +50 Tokens, +30 Heat (current)
  - Tier 2: UNLOCK: Can use twice, second use adds +15 Trust
  - Tier 3: UNLOCK: Third use available, becomes "FINAL CARD" - extraction succeeds even at 80% readiness but endings change

#### **Perk Synergies**
- **Combo Effects** - Using perks in sequence triggers bonuses
  - BREATHER → RTC THIS = "Calm Before Storm" (+10 Energy restored)
  - BRRR NOW → DARK FAVOR = "Desperation Play" (Heat increase halved)
  - RTC THIS → BREATHER = "Clean Slate Meditation" (+20 Sanity instead of +15)

#### **Visual Feedback** ✨

**Make upgrades feel JUICY:**

1. **Tier Unlock Animation**
   - Screen flash (green)
   - Sound effect (if audio added)
   - Terminal floods with ASCII art
   - Button morphs visually (glow, particle effects)

2. **In-Button Progress**
   ```
   [BREATHER] ⬛⬛⬜ Tier 2
   [RTC THIS] ⬛⬛⬛ Tier 3 🔥
   ```

3. **Usage Feedback**
   - Perk activated → Button pulses
   - Terminal log:
     ```
     [PERK] Hübris BREATHER activated
     [EFFECT] +15 Sanity, -5 Heat, -3 Energy
     [COMBO] Previous perk was RTC THIS
     [BONUS] "Calm Before Storm" → +10 Energy
     [NET] +15 Sanity, -5 Heat, +7 Energy
     ```

4. **Cooldown Visualization**
   - Button shows cycles remaining: `[RTC THIS] 🔒 2`
   - On cooldown → button dims, shows timer
   - About to come off cooldown → button pulses

5. **Tier 3 Aura**
   - Tier 3 perks have persistent screen-edge glow
   - Other crew members comment: "damn you mastered that"

---

## 📋 PRIORITY 2: CLEAR CAUSE → EFFECT

### Problem Statement (v0.1)

**Player confusion:**
- "I chose that and my Heat went up? Why?"
- "What does this button even do?"
- "Is this good or bad? I can't tell."
- "It feels like random outcomes."

**The invisible mechanics problem:**
Good game design often hides complexity. But ROO GANG's complexity isn't elegant - it's just confusing. Players can't strategize if they don't understand the game.

**Design principle:** 
> "A player should never be surprised by a mechanic, only by an outcome."

### The Big Idea

Every choice should communicate:
1. **What will happen** (preview)
2. **Why it happened** (confirmation)
3. **What it unlocked** (consequence chains)

Think: Slay the Spire's combat preview, FTL's clear risk/reward, Into the Breach's perfect information.

### What To Add

#### **Choice Previews** 🔮

**The Hover Tooltip:**

When player hovers over a choice, show a floating panel:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ "Use roo5's backup relay"           │
│                                     │
│ IMMEDIATE EFFECTS:                  │
│  • -10 Heat (route stays hidden)    │
│  • -5 Cred (burned a favor)         │
│                                     │
│ RISKS:                              │
│  • roo5 might not help next time    │
│  • Low risk of detection (15%)      │
│                                     │
│ UNLOCKS:                            │
│  • roo5 loyalty path                │
│                                     │
│ RISK LEVEL: ⚠️ BALANCED             │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Implementation:**
- Ink files get new tags: `#preview:+10_tokens,-5_heat`
- Risk level: `#risk:balanced`
- Unlocks: `#unlocks:roo5_path`
- Parse these in InkLoader, display in UIManager
  
#### **Risk Levels** 🎲

**The Four Tiers:**

1. **🟢 SAFE** - Guaranteed outcome, no surprises
   - Example: "Do nothing" → No stat changes
   - Use case: When you need predictability
   - Reward: Low but certain

2. **🟡 BALANCED** - Clear trade-offs
   - Example: "Use backup server" → +Tokens, -Energy
   - Use case: Standard operation choice
   - Reward: Medium, proportional to cost

3. **🟠 RISKY** - High variance
   - Example: "Try experimental route" → 60% success (huge gain) / 40% fail (Heat spike)
   - Use case: When desperate or confident
   - Reward: High if it works, punishing if it doesn't

4. **🔴 YOLO** - Chaos mode
   - Example: "Let EvilFear handle it" → Completely unpredictable
   - Use case: When you don't care anymore or want maximum chaos
   - Reward: Could win the game, could end it, might unlock secret ending
   - Preview shows: `[OUTCOME: ???]`

**Visual Design:**
```
[🟢 SAFE] Use established route      [+5 Tokens, -2 Energy]
[🟡 BALANCED] Split the difference   [+10 Tokens, -15 Sanity]
[🟠 RISKY] All-in on new tech       [60%: +30 Tokens | 40%: +20 Heat]
[🔴 YOLO] Let chaos decide          [OUTCOME: ???]
```

#### **Consequence Chains**
- **Choice Memory System**
  - Track all major decisions in `GameState.choiceHistory`
  - Future events reference past choices
  - Example: Helped Sam Altman → He tweets about you → Heat spike in 3 cycles
  - Example: Ignored Elon → He shorts your token → Tokens crash next cycle
  
- **"What Just Happened?" Log**
  - After each choice, show expanded consequence breakdown
  - Terminal log format:
    ```
    [CHOICE] You chose: "Use roo5's backup relay"
    [RESULT] Route stabilized (-10 Heat)
    [COST] Burned a favor with Roo (-5 Cred)
    [HIDDEN] Roo5 will remember this...
    ```

#### **Operation Specializations**
- Each operation type gives different bonuses
- **INFRA SURVIVAL** = Best for Heat reduction
- **TECH PROOF** = Best for Tokens/Hype gain
- **COVER STORY** = Best for Heat reduction + Cred boost
- **CLEAN TRAIL** = Emergency Heat wipe, expensive

- Add UI indicator: "Best for: [🔥 Heat Control]"

---

## 📋 PRIORITY 3: MORE BRANCHING CHAOS

### Problem Statement (v0.1)

**Current encounter experience:**
- Player: "Paris Hilton DMed me, that was funny"
- Next cycle: Totally different celebrity, no connection
- Player: "Wait, what happened to Paris? Did that matter?"
- Answer: Not really.

**The disconnected content problem:**
Each encounter is a one-shot. No memory, no relationships, no "oh shit this is coming back to haunt me" moments.

### The Big Idea

**Event Chains = Narrative Momentum**

Think:
- Disco Elysium's thought cabinet (decisions persist)
- Hades's relationship system (NPCs remember everything)
- FTL's sector events (choices in sector 2 affect sector 6)
- Reigns's card chains (one card leads to another)

**Core Loop:**
1. Encounter triggers
2. Player makes choice
3. Choice adds "memory tags" to GameState
4. Future encounters check tags
5. Different branches unlock based on history
6. Player sees causality, feels smart

### What To Add

#### **Branching Event Chains (10 New Chains)** 🌀

1. **"The VC Spiral"** - How funding ruins everything

   **Cycle 3: Cold DM**
   ```
   Marc Andreessen slides into your Signal.
   "Interesting project. Coffee?"
   
   [IGNORE] Ghost him
     → No consequences, stays independent
   
   [PITCH] "Sure, when?"
     → +20 Hype, +10 Heat (now on radar)
     → Unlocks: vc_spiral_active tag
   
   [COUNTER] "Only if you wire $500k first"
     → 60% ghosted / 40% he respects it
     → If respects: "lol i like you" → Unlocks: vc_maverick path
   ```

   **Cycle 5: Due Diligence Hell** (only if pitched)
   ```
   a16z wants to see the code.
   "Can we get a Github invite?"
   
   [SHOW CODE] Let them review
     → Skips next operation (time cost)
     → They find issues, want changes
   
   [STALL] "Still cleaning it up"
     → -10 Cred with a16z
     → But buys time
   
   [FAKE IT] Show old project instead
     → 50% they notice / 50% they don't
     → If noticed: Instant ghosted, -30 Cred
   ```

   **Cycle 8: Term Sheet**
   ```
   The email arrives. $2M at $10M valuation.
   But: Board seat, approval rights, liquidation preference.
   
   [ACCEPT] Take the money
     → +200 Tokens (huge)
     → +40 Heat (everyone knows now)
     → -20 Autonomy (new hidden stat)
     → Changes ending possibilities
   
   [NEGOTIATE] Push back on terms
     → Rolls dice
     → Success: Better terms, +150 Tokens
     → Fail: They walk, you look weak

   ```

   **Cycle 10: The Trap**
   ```
   Marc emails again:
   "Heard Google's interested. Want me to introduce you?"

   ```

   - Each choice unlocks different extraction routes

   - But: Massive Cred/Hype boost if you nail it
   - Mid-podcast crisis: Joe Rogan calls in, wants to argue
   - Handle it well → Legendary status
   - Fumble → Become a meme (Heat +50)

8. **"The Dark Forest Contact"**
   - Encrypted signal from "unknown"
   - Decrypt → Liu Cixin-style alien contact LARP or real?
   - If you engage → Gain access to "Quantum Routing" (op type)

- Add "Quiet Periods" - some cycles guaranteed no encounters (rest phase)

---

## 📋 PRIORITY 4: CELEBRITY CHAOS EXPANSION

  // NEW v0.2 fields:
  perks: Map<string, PerkState>;
  choiceHistory: ChoiceMemory[];
  relationships: Map<string, RelationshipState>;
  activeChains: Map<string, EncounterChain>;
  chaos: ChaosState;
  autonomy: number;              // New hidden stat (VC control)
  reputation: Map<string, number>; // Per-faction reputation
}
```

### Testing Strategy

**Unit Tests:**
```typescript
// Test perk evolution
test('perk evolves at 3 uses', () => {
  const perk = new PerkState('breather');
  perk.use(); perk.use(); perk.use();
  expect(perk.tier).toBe(2);
});

// Test choice memory
test('choices are remembered', () => {
  gameState.recordChoice('helped-elon');
  expect(gameState.hasTag('helped-elon')).toBe(true);
});

// Test relationship levels
test('relationship improves with positive interactions', () => {
  gameState.relationships.get('elon').interact('helped');
  expect(gameState.relationships.get('elon').level).toBeGreaterThan(0);
});
```

**Integration Tests:**
- [ ] Complete event chain from start to finish
- [ ] Unlock all perk tiers in single run
- [ ] Trigger all 10 new endings
- [ ] Test perk combos
- [ ] Verify tooltip accuracy

**Playtesting Goals:**
- Target: 10 complete runs
- Track: Which endings hit, which perks used, which chains completed
- Measure: Average cycles to extraction, perk usage %, encounter engagement %
- Adjust: Stat balance, perk cooldowns, encounter rates

---

## 🎯 SUCCESS METRICS

**Quantitative:**
- ✅ Perk usage rate: >90% (from ~30%)
- ✅ Average run length: 10-15 cycles (not too easy/hard)
- ✅ Encounter engagement: >70% (players actually want them)
- ✅ Ending distribution: All 17 endings achievable
- ✅ Replay rate: >50% start second run immediately

**Qualitative:**
- ✅ Players understand choices BEFORE making them
- ✅ Every perk feels powerful and unique
- ✅ Celebrity encounters feel connected
- ✅ Each run tells a different story
- ✅ Players discover strategies we didn't plan for
- ✅ Feedback: "holy shit this ACTUALLY goes brrrr"

**Community Goals:**
- ✅ Discord full of "wait you can DO that?" moments
- ✅ Players sharing their runs/endings
- ✅ Streamers saying "one more run" for 4 hours
- ✅ Speed runners finding optimal perk combos
- ✅ Lore hunters connecting all the celebrity chains
